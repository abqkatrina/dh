Dissecting Horror website

Dissecting  Horror is a podcast studying horror film creation and presentation from both technical and cultural perspectives. This code project contains basic html, less, and javascript files for the creation of a single-page site using skills learned during the first three weeks at Lambda School. This is a personal side project and will improve incrementally as new skills are acquired/ changes are requested by the podcast producers.

If you notice any bugs or general flaws in this code, please let me know!
